# Image Completion with QuatIca

## Overview

QuatIca provides powerful quaternion-based image completion capabilities using advanced matrix decomposition techniques. This application demonstrates how quaternion matrices can effectively restore missing or corrupted image data.

## Key Features

- **Multiple completion strategies** for different image types and corruption patterns
- **Real image completion** for practical restoration scenarios
- **Synthetic image completion** for controlled testing and validation
- **Small image completion** for rapid prototyping and development

## Available Scripts

### Real Image Completion
```bash
python applications/image_completion/script_real_image_completion.py
```
Handles real-world image completion tasks with various corruption patterns and noise levels.

### Synthetic Image Completion
```bash
python applications/image_completion/script_synthetic_image_completion.py
```
Generates synthetic test cases for systematic evaluation of completion algorithms.

### Small Image Completion
```bash
python applications/image_completion/script_small_image_completion.py
```
Optimized for quick testing with smaller image dimensions.

## Methodology

The image completion process leverages quaternion matrix factorization:

1. **Quaternion Encoding**: Images are represented as quaternion matrices where each quaternion encodes color channel information
2. **Matrix Decomposition**: Advanced quaternion SVD and factorization techniques identify underlying structure
3. **Completion Algorithm**: Missing pixels are estimated using low-rank quaternion matrix completion
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Newton-Schulz and other iterative methods refine the completion

## Applications

- **Photo restoration** - Repair damaged or corrupted images
- **Missing data recovery** - Complete images with systematic missing regions
- **Noise reduction** - Clean corrupted image data while preserving structure
- **Compression artifacts removal** - Restore quality in heavily compressed images

## Performance Benefits

QuatIca's quaternion-based approach offers several advantages:
- **Color coherence** - Naturally preserves color relationships across channels
- **Structural preservation** - Maintains geometric features and patterns
- **Computational efficiency** - Optimized quaternion operations reduce processing time
- **Robust completion** - Handles various corruption patterns effectively

## Getting Started

1. **Prepare your image** in a supported format (PNG, JPEG)
2. **Choose the appropriate script** based on your completion task
3. **Configure parameters** for corruption type and completion method
4. **Run the completion** and examine results in `output_figures/`

For detailed parameter descriptions and advanced usage, see the individual script documentation.
